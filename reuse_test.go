// White-box test for the visibility contract on a shape the analysistest
// corpus cannot express: every position the corpus produces lies inside one of
// the pass's file scopes, so the no-enclosing-scope guard is reachable only
// through the API. The contract it pins: a position outside every file scope
// resolves nothing, so the reuse fix is skipped rather than emitted with a
// reference that cannot be checked.
